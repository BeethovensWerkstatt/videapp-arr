# About Verovio

VideApp-arr requires more than the standard 128mb RAM for Verovio to render some examples, most notably op.133. This version is a specially compiled development version of Verovio, with 256mb assigned. It dates to 2019-12-11. There is no automatic update of Verovio built into this repo. Kudos Laurent Pugin for the assistance.
